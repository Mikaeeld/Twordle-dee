# Sprint 3 Retrospective

## Results

### User facing

- The code to join rooms was created and deployed for users to access.
- The front end display was neatened up and formatted for the user to view.
- The timer was reformatted for a better viewing experience.
- The scoring system was improved upon.
- The users name can be remembered across different sessions.

### Developer facing

- A database was created using mongodb to store the users details.
- The score functionality was moved to the back-end to restrict unnecessary public data access
- the back end rematch functionality was set up.
- The generation, storing and receiving of the code to play a multiplayer game was set up.

## Stories

- 8 user stories were to-do at the beginning of this sprint
- 1 new user story was created during this sprint

- 7 user stories were completed
- 2 user stories was not started

- The 8 planned user stories amounted to 16 points
- The 7 user stories completed amounted to 14 points
- Thus, the **estimated** velocity was **16** points/sprint whereas the **actual** velocity was **14** points/sprint
- Thus, the total sprint velocity was **13.6** points/sprint over all sprints

## Successes

- The team continued to show good communication and teamwork
- Every team member completed and reviewed a story
- Tests accompanied each pull request and were vertical slices
- While not many stories were completed, their point value were high.
- The front end user experience was greatly enhanced
- Group members worked on using Github to respond to reviews.
- Story completion levels were better estimated at the beginning of the sprint according to the sprint velocity.

## Areas of Concern

- Setting up of back-end code was met with technical difficulties, but was solved by working as a group
- Success criteria need to be added to stories
- Integration testing is required
- Sprint velocity was low, this was due to other unforeseen commitments of team members

## Future plans

- Team members are committed to making themselves available for the final sprint and hope to work through large parts of the backlog.
- The release deadline is near, and extra effort will be taken to ensure completion of all stories.
