# Sprint 3 Retrospective

## Results

### User facing

- The front-end display was neatened up and formatted for the user to view.
- The timer was reformatted for a better viewing experience.
- The scoring system was improved upon.
- The users can create, edit, and log in to their account
- Uses data is stored securely and governed by a privacy policy shared with the user.
- The multiplayer rematch button was added.

### Developer facing

- The database will store the userâ€™s username and password.
- The above database was encrypted.
- User passwords are hashed
- Cookies will be used to store a randomly generated token along with the username to allow for transition between routes.
- Code covered reports were generated using Coveralls.

## Stories

- 8 user stories were to-do at the beginning of this sprint
- 3 new user stories were created during this sprint

- 11 user stories were completed

- The 8 planned user stories amounted to 17 points
- The 11 user stories completed amounted to 22 points
- Thus, the *estimated* velocity was *17* points/sprint whereas the *actual* velocity was *22* points/sprint
- Thus, the total sprint velocity was *15.7* points/sprint overall sprints (previously 13.6)

## Successes

As this is the last sprint the success criteria will also include comments of the entire project as a whole

- The team continued to show good communication and teamwork
- Every team member completed and reviewed a story
- Tests accompanied each pull request and were vertical slices
- The two added stories accounted for bug fixes, thus the estimated sprint velocity was very accurate.
- The front-end user experience was greatly enhanced.
- Group members worked on using Github to respond to reviews and make changes based on the feedback provided.
- Users' data is stored securely. The user passwords are to be hashed upon account creation. Cookies will be used to store a randomly generated to keep track of when a user is logged in. These tokens are hashed in the database.  
- A privacy policy was added to inform the user about the security and storage of their data
- In case of any breach in security, users can change their passwords
- Code covered reports were generated using Coveralls.
- Functionality to create, log in and edit accounts was added.
- Small bugs were identified and fixed.
- The ability for a player to choose a word for the game was added in the multiplayer game. This player will then not take part in the game.
- Players can access and download a log of the game that captures all actions taken.
- All team members put in extra work this week to finalise the project and put in the finishing touches. This was communicated to the team last week and all members followed through on this.

### Looking at the all the sprints as a whole

- Each sprint was one week long, with a minimum of 7 stories in each sprint. $ full sprints were completed.
- All group members worked together cohesively in this project and communicated well.
- All group members committed and reviewed an issue every week.
- Regular meetings were held to discuss progress and solve issues.
- Testing of each story was done from the beginning and in each story.
- A minimum viable project was produced at the end of each sprint that shows the development towards the final product using trunk based development. The trunk was never in a broken state.
- Test coverage of core and enhanced functionality is at 91%.
- A final polished user experience was achieved.
- Additional functionality added includes a scoring system, rematch ability, and a secure user account system. This creates a more cohesive user experience as the game will remember the user across devices, and these functions will create a more competitive multiplayer environment which will enhance the user experience.
- The AGILE methodology was followed through the project duration.
- All stories were accompanied with tests and were vertical slices.
- Persistence data storage was used.
