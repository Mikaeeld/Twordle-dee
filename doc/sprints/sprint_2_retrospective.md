- Thus, the **estimated** velocity was **20** points/sprint whereas the **actual** velocity was **11** points/sprint
- Thus, the total sprint velocity was **13.5** points/sprint

## Successes

- The team continued to show good communication and teamwork
- Every team member completed and reviewed a story
- Tests accompanied each pull request and were vertical slices

## Areas of Concern

- Group members did not use Github to respond to reviews, this was done in-person with no paper trail
- Code is lacking comments
- Code is in need of refactoring
- Review guide is not strictly followed, team members should be more strict regarding this going forward
- Success criteria need to be added to stories
- Integration testing is required
- Sprint velocity was low, this was due to other unforeseen commitments of team members
