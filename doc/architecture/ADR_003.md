# ADR 2: Frontend Styling Using Bootstrap

## Context

The app requires css elements in order to create a functional and pleasing user interface. This would be best achieved using off the shelf solutions instead of writing our own

## Decision

Bootstrap will be used to provide styling for elements of the user interface. The bootstrap stylesheet will be stored on the server in the public directory.

## Status: Accepted

## Consequences

The use of bootstrap will simplify interface creation significantly. It will have minimal impact in other regards since it can be excluded where necessary.
