# ADR 3: AJAX API

## Context

A REST API is required to communicate data between the server, and the 
web application. This ADR serves to standardise the REST procedure 

## Decision

The Jest test framework will be used, a "\_\_tests\_\_" folder will be created to hold test functions. Jest coverage tests will be used to ensure code coverage. supertest will be used to test express routes without an http server in the local environment.

## Status: Pending Approval

## Consequences

Testing is required for continuous integration/deployment as well as code quality. Future code will need to be written with tests in mind, exisitng code may need refactoring.
