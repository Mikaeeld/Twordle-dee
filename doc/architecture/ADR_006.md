# ADR 6: Using MongoDB to create and log in with an account

## Context
The ADR builds on from ADR_004
The project brief requires players to be identified so that they can access a log of their action taken. 
Basic security practices will be used to protect data.
This was done throgh using a MongoDB to store the users details. This was chosen as data storage needs to be persistent. 

MongoDB was chosen for its ease to update the required user details if needs be, such as name and surname, and for its security and authentication features. 


### Description
The users username, password, email and phone number will be stored. 
Currentrly their name is not needed, and this level of personal detail is unnecessary at this point. This can  be easilly exapaned on
in the future if needs be,

This was implemented in files:  user.controllers.js, user.js , routes.controllers.js and main.routes.js
Models have  be included via a main `Models.js` file.


## Status: Accepted

## Consequences

This will affect how users log into the web application. 
Only users with an account created will be able to access the web-app. If they do not have an account they will be redirected to create one.
