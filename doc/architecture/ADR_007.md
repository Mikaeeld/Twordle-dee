# ADR 7: Long Polling & NodeJS Event Listeners

## Context
Multiplayer interaction requires two-way, instantaneous, communication between the server and 
the client. One such mean of attempting this is to poll a RESTful API, however this leads to server-overloading
and excessive network traffic. A better approach is to perform long polling: when a client makes an API request
to the server, however the server suspends the response until an event occurs; this keeps the connection alive
until a response is received. NodeJS events can also be used to 'broadcast' multiplayer interactions between the 
waiting connections that each client has with the server.

Lastly it is important to note that alternative solutions such as WebSockets and implementations such as socket.io
do offer some advantages, however they were not considered as they would require a significant changes in the existing
REST infrastructure such as authentication, and query-related endpoints and middleware.

## Decision

Long polling will be implemented using NodeJS events to fulfil the communication of multiplayer interactions.

## Status: Approved

## Consequences

- Client side requests should allow for long timeouts, and reconnection redundancy.
- Only changes in state should be communicated where possible
- A hash of the complete object representing the state should be communicated
- When the hash fails then the full state object should be communicated
- Events should be properly labelled using the scheme: '{Name of Message event}unique identifier' 
to ensure that the correct listening parties only receive relevant communications
