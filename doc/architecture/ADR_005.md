# ADR 5: MongoDB and Mongoose

## Context
MongoDB is a NoSQL database system that can be used for persistent data storage
with relatively lenient (compared to SQL DBMS) structure specifications. Mongoose
is a NodeJS ORM that works with MongoDB.

## Decision
MongoDB and Mongoose are used as the persistent storage mechanism.
The database table or 'collection' does not have to be created ahead of
time and can be created as needed by defining a mongoose model.

Models are stored in the `src/models` folder as well as any seeder code.
A model seeder populates a database with specific instances of the model such as a word list, 
or predefined categories.

The MongoDB connection is opened once via Mongoose in the main application.

## Status: Approved

## Consequences
All persistence storage should use a Mongoose model to store data in 
a MongoDB database.

Models should be included via a main `Models.js` file.
